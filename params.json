The database will be created for you on the first run - in the same directory as the executable resides (for command line users: in your current working directory).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n0. Go to `http://localhost:8080`\r\n1. Enter your fixed expenses (like rent or other stuff that is not mutable but recurrent)\r\n2. This calculates your \"magic number\", your daily amount of money you can spend\r\n3. Enter each new expense you have. There is no categorization, since I always found those to be too tedious to make it a habit\r\n4. Have control over your finances - purchase for purchase, day after day!\r\n5. You can manage categorization afterwards under \"Categories\" - you freely choose a categorization scheme for all your expenses. Expenses with the same name will receive the same category (so e.g. every Transaction with the name \"Supermarket\" will be categorized under \"Groceries\")\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
